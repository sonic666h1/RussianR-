## A simple python russian roulette game!

work in progress.

I would recommend you get python from Microsoft Store, To run it just pull up cmd on the folder and write " python ws.py ".

If you're monke brain like me : search cmd in win search then do "cd C:path\to\the\folder "
It would look like this = " cd C:\Users\sonic\Downloads\GameFolder " For me.
