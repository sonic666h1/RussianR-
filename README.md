## A simple python russian roulette game!

work in progress.

I would recommend you get python from Microsoft Store, To run it just pull up cmd on the folder and write " python ws.py ".

If you're monke brain like me : search cmd in win search then do "cd C:path\to\the\folder "
It would look like this = " cd C:\Users\sonic\Downloads\GameFolder " For me.

Note. The sounds need to be in the same folder where the sw.py file is at.

Simpler Tutorial:

# 1. Download the .zip file =
